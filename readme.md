## About the Models

All of the models in the [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/)

- We highly recommend you check out this [installation guide](https://pytorch.org/) for the "torch" library so you can install the appropriate version on your device.
- To utilize GPU (optional), you also need to install the CUDA library, you may want to check out this [installation guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-quick-start-guide/index.html).
- [Python 3.9.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/) is recommended, which has been fully tested without issues.

## About the Experiment Replication

We have made available the source code for all experiments, including vulnerability detection (RQ1), vulnerability type identification (RQ2), and cross-domain vulnerability detection (RQ5). 

To reproduce the results for RQ1, you can navigate to the RQ1 folder and execute the code contained within. The same process applies to the other RQs. 

By following these steps, you should be able to replicate our experiments and obtain similar results. Please let us know if you encounter any issues during the process, and we will be happy to assist you.
